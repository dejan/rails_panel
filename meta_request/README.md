# MetaRequest

Supporting gem for [Rails Panel (Google Chrome extension for Rails development)](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel).

## Installation

Add meta_request gem to development group in Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'meta_request'
end
```

## Usage

See [Rails Panel extension](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel).

## Compatibility Warnings

If you're using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) or
[Rack::LiveReload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload) make sure to
exclude watching your tmp/ folder because meta_request writes a lot of data there
and your browser will refresh like a madman.
