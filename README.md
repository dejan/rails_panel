RailsPanel
===========

RailsPanel is a Chrome extension for Rails development that will end your tailing of development.log. Have all information about your Rails app requests in the browser - in the Developer Tools panel. Provides insight to db/rendering/total times, parameter list, rendered views and more.

## Installation

To use this extension you need to add meta_request gem to your app's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'meta_request'
end
```


Install the extension from [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/railspanel/gjpfobpafnhjhbajcjgccbbdofdckggg). This is recommended way of installing extension, since it will auto-update on every new version. Note that you still need to update meta_request gem yourself. Make sure you're signed in to chrome webstore since [apparently webstore is broken when you are not](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel/issues/6#issuecomment-11776952).

## Install unpacked version

If you have a problem installing extension from Chrome Store or just want to run latest and hack on it, just clone the repo (say under ~/workspace/rails_panel) and in "Developer mode" Chrome Extensions page select "Load Unpacked extension..." and select "~/workspace/rails_panel/rails_panel".
