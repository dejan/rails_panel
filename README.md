## Installation

To use this extension you need to add meta_request gem to your app's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'meta_request'
end
```

Install RailsPanel extension from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/railspanel/gjpfobpafnhjhbajcjgccbbdofdckggg). This is recommended way of installing extension, since it will auto-update on every new version. Note that you still need to update meta_request gem yourself.

## Install unpacked version

If you have a problem installing extension from Chrome Store or just want to run latest and hack on it, just clone the repo (say under ~/workspace/rails_panel) and in "Developer mode" Chrome Extensions page select "Load Unpacked extension..." and select "~/workspace/rails_panel/rails_panel".

## Supported environments

* Rails 3, Rails 4
* Ruby 1.9.3, Ruby 2.0, Ruby 2.1

## Editor integration

Select your editor on the extension options page: chrome://extensions. Following editors are supported:

* MacVim
* TextMate
* Sublime
* Emacs
* Atom 
* RubyMine

## Compatibility Warnings

If you're using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) or
[Rack::LiveReload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload) make sure to
exclude watching your tmp/ folder because meta_request writes a lot of data there
and your browser will refresh like a madman.

## Clearing the Console

You can clear the panel with the usual shortcuts of âŒ˜+k or ctrl+l.
